<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My goal for Tuesday was to add the popup bubbles to big cities on the map on my website.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong> I used the <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup-on-click/">Mapbox GL JS</a> to add speech bubbles and icons to the the map. We came into some trouble with the icons because we needed to enable sprites in the style. We did that by going to Mapbox Studio and enabling the sprite icons that I wanted to use in my style. A sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene such as a 2D video game.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I now have a map that fully works and there are multiple cities throughout the U.S. that have the popup bubbles on my <a href="https://xiomaraquinonez.github.io/MAGIC/#">website.</a></p>

<h2 id="friday-1122">Friday, 11/22</h2>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> My goal for today was to get the theme for my Blog working.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong> I used a <a href="https://www.jekyll.com.cn/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/">Jekyll theme reference sheet</a> and followed the instructions on how to get the website to become responsive.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I have a basic website that is able to load all my content, but the theme is still not set on my Blog.</p>

<p><strong>What I tried:</strong> I wrote Markdown today. Markdown is formatting for text on Github that is easy to write and easy to read.</p>

<p><strong>Terminal:</strong></p>

<p><strong>ls:</strong> stands for list files, which will lead to all files from the current directory being listed</p>

<p><strong>cd:</strong> stands for change directory, which allows us to move through files</p>

<p><strong>pwd:</strong> stands for print working directory, writes the full pathname for the current directory</p>

<p><strong>:wq:</strong> stands for write and quit, used after changes have been committed</p>

<p><strong>git status:</strong> shows the status of the files whether they have been commited or not</p>

<p><strong>git commit -m:</strong> used to type in the commit message</p>

<p><strong>git push:</strong> sends the committed changes to the repository</p>

<p><strong>git pull:</strong> merges changes from server to directory</p>

<p><strong>git config:</strong> sets the author name and email address to be used with commits</p>

<p><strong>git init:</strong> used to create a new repository</p>

<p><strong>git add:</strong> adds a file</p>

<p><strong>Github Pages:</strong></p>

<p><strong>markdown:</strong> formatting for text on Github that is easy to read and write</p>

<p><strong>##:</strong> used to create titles</p>

<p>**: used to bold words/letters</p>

<p><strong>index.md:</strong> page where the markdown goes</p>

<h2 id="news-4-u-website">News 4 U Website</h2>

<p>I have began using the terminal commands that I learned when working on my website, News 4 U. News 4 U is a a website that I created using HTML and CSS over the summer with a mentor who guided me through the process. News 4 U is used to help teenagers become more aware of current world issues and provides them with ways to get involved in their cities.</p>

<p>The main problem that I ran into with this website was getting the Google Map to work due to the API key not working. At first, I only had my mentorâ€™s API Key. I tried to add the Github domain to my API key, but it did not work. However, I was able to fix this using another tool - Mapbox.</p>

<p>For my static files directory set up, I have have folders that were meant to store different parts of the code.</p>

<p>In order to put the website on Github Pages, I first signed up for Gihub. Then, I got SSH set up. SSH allows users to connect to Github without having to input their login information each time they are modifying their code. Next, I set up my static files on github and moved the index page to the root directory due to a problem with not being able to access it for a while. After a couple weeks of not making any edits, an image was not showing up on one of the pages due to the article from where the image came from being removed from a source. To fix this, I deleted the link and modified the code. Laslty, to fix the final problem of the Google Map, I switched to Mapbox. I created an account for this, set a style that I thought would go well with the website, and used a Mapbox token in place of the previous API key.</p>
