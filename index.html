       <font size="1000">
       <br>Goal: My goal for Tuesday was to add the popup bubbles to big cities on the map on my website.</br> 
       <br>Process: In order to accomplish this goal, I used the mapbox webiste for reference on ways to add images and text within the map.</br>
       <br>Problem: A problem that I ran into this tuesday was finding a way to upload images to my map.</br>
       <br>Solution: A solution for my image problem involved using mapbox code as reference and getting help from my supervisor, Kajari.</br>
       <br>Outcome: I now have a map that fully works and there are multiple cities throughout the U.S. that have the popup bubbles on my map.</br>
