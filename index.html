     <h1>Tuesday, 11/19<h1>
     <p>
       <br>Goal: My goal for Tuesday was to add the popup bubbles to big cities on the map on my website.</br>
       <br>Process: I used the <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup-on-click/">Mapbox GL JS</a> to add speech bubbles and icons to the the map. We came into some trouble with the icons because we needed to enable sprites in the style. We did that by going to Mapbox Studio and enabling the sprite icons that I wanted to use in my style. A sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene such as a 2D video game.</br>
       <br>Outcome: I now have a map that fully works and there are multiple cities throughout the U.S. that have the popup bubbles on my <a href="https://xiomaraquinonez.github.io/MAGIC/#">website.</a></br>
